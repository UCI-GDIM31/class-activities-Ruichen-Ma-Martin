tablet 19# line 17 declear a varible the type is bool which is a basic C# data type which stores a true or false value. the name of variable is _isGround.
line 28 is an if statement. the condition of the statement is when player press space and _isGround is true. the code in the bracket {} will work. 
line 32 is a change the _isGround variable from true to false. this code will work when reach the condition. this will prevent the player jump in the sky.
tablet 19# ball and cat need rigidbody because they need phyiscal body when the cat hit the ball. the goal don't need a phyiscal body and it will check trigger because it need to record when the ball pass through the goal. during I add the component I find that the cat is floating on the sky. and the problem of this bug is that the size of collidor is too large after i edit the size the collider the cat will not floating.

my question is how tranform.Translate() this method used?
base on professor and classmate answer: I think this method is use to call the component transform and Translate is to add some number in the position part.
activity 2: for the varible we need first is the speed of object moveing. also it need the speed of object turning
I think this method is provide by unity like Update(). it must include Update() ND Start()
